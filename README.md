Cyclistic is a fictional bike - share company in Chicago. It has a bike - share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It also offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
It has 3 pricing plans:
1) Single - Ride Passes
2) Full - Day Passes
3) Annual Memberships
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

My Task: To determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
